The EasiTag strategy is based on the standard topN strategy but has some modifications and extensions. 
In EasiTag, the precursor selection is more stringent and only select monoisotopic peaks for fragmentation. 
Furthermore, the isolation windows are shifted by a global offset and their size chosen to be charge state dependent.
